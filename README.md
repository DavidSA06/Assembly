Used for **PIC microcontrollers**.

Most of the files were designed for the purpose of classroom teaching for the *Digital Electronics Class* (Electronics II) at FCFM-BUAP. The teaching projects and homework were done on the **PIC16F84** for the most part while the research projects were done on a **PIC16F877A**. For this reason several lines are commented. 

Remember to **star** in this project if you like it.

### Timers (0 and 1)

- **Timer0**: blinking of an LED controlled by flag checking.
- **Timer0**: blinking of an LED using interruptions.
- **Timer1**

### Mathematical Operations

- **Addition**: preloaded number and input from **PORT A**.
- **Multiplication**: by Adding n times.
- **Multiplication**: by Rotation.

### Counting

Various printing methods are used (LEDs, 8-segment-Display(s), LED Matrix).

- **Binary Counter**: using 8 LEDs.
- **Binary Counter (RB0)**: using 8 LEDs.
- **Random Display**: shows a *random* number using an 8-segment display.
- **Decimal Counter**: using a 8-segment display.
- **Hexadecimal Counter**: using a 8-segment display.
- **Double Hexadecimal Counter**: using two 8-segment displays.
- **LED Matrix**.

### Special Tutorials

- **PWM**.
- **Frecuencimeter**.
- **SPI Master**.
- **SPI Slave**.

**CAD3CHPIC40P** is a program that can obtain measurements from three analog sensors using a **PIC16F877A**. You can download the **LabVIEW** program that extracts the data while measuring [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlHm4mxXeqj1wB8x2MhkZWDrKY0Njtm3/view?usp=sharing).

In **Pending_Projects** directory there are files that need a revision or translation.
